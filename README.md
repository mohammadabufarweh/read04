<li>Information is added to a form.</li>
<li>A web page has finished loading.</li>
</ul>

`alert("Hello");`

so when we write this command the webpage onpen box

### SLIDE SHOW
if you want to present web page cotent easily and
more interactive you can use slide show which able
to confirme different images at same space .

### FORMS
so if we want a different data from the user 
best way to do it by form ,at form the user can
simply add the data and if there any mistake in
data entery the javascript give alert to user

### RELOAD PART OF PAGE
so when you have data entire web page you do not
need o force the user to refresh the page i you have option which able the developor to refresh a portion of a page 

### WRITING A SCRIPT
As you star any thing first you should put plan
and state the goal of your javascript,then you have to design the script 
so, you can put down individual steps of commands in order
to complete each step ,Every step for every task shown
in a flowchart needs to be written
in a language the computer can
understand and follow and learn to think like a computer
to be faster and mor professional .
 
 Examples:


`var m = 'This is Mohammad webpage';`

`prompt("5+5=?");`

FUNCTION

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
 
Example

`alert ("Tesla of course");`
here in this command we have alert is a functionketword 
and ("Tesla of course") is a function name
